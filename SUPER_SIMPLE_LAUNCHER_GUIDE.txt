=== SUPER SIMPLE LAUNCHER GUIDE ===

This file explains how to use the '超级简单启动器.bat' file.

### WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
The previous launch scripts had Chinese characters which might cause encoding issues on some Windows systems.
This super simple launcher uses ONLY ENGLISH text to avoid these encoding problems.

### HOW TO USE
1. Double-click the file: 超级简单启动器.bat
2. The script will:
   - Check if Node.js dependencies are installed
   - Install dependencies if needed
   - Start the development server
3. After the server starts, open your browser and visit:
   http://localhost:5173/

### IMPORTANT NOTES
- Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer
- If you don't have Node.js, download it from: https://nodejs.org/
- To stop the server, press Ctrl+C in the command window

### TROUBLESHOOTING
- If the server fails to start, try these steps:
  1. Open Command Prompt (Win+R, type 'cmd', press Enter)
  2. Navigate to the project folder: cd /d "%userprofile%\Documents\Trea CN\statistical-webapp"
  3. Run these commands one by one:
     npm install @vitejs/plugin-react --save-dev
     npm install
     npm run dev

This super simple launcher is designed to work on any Windows system regardless of language settings or encoding configurations.
